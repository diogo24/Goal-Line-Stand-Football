Draft Theories:

-SkillsTranslateToNFL controls how much of their actual abilities the player will maintain once in the NFL
and will be modified by Instincts, WorkEthic, and Intelligence(Wonderlic score).

-Scouts/GM's will "see" players they are drafting based on a combination of combine results, college stats, 
their abilities to judge prospects(how close they are at determining their actual translatable skills), and 
and their abilities to judge that particular position.

-Team Doctors will see prospects injuries based on how strict their injury guidelines are. Less strict means
that more players will be medically cleared by them to be drafted, but could have injury issues.  More strict
means that fewer players will be cleared by them to be drafted, lessening injury risks, but they also may
miss out on players who will become very good players.

Scout Ability for Position:

Determines chance the scout misses and by how much:

ChanceToFail=Scout Rating*.7---Best scout is right about 70% of time

If Scout Succeeds, prospect is rated within 1 round of actual talent---the better the scout,
the better chance of being right on.

If Scout Fails, prospect is rated 2-4 rounds above or beneath actual talent---better the scout,
the closer he is...
