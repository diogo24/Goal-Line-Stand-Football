 <summary>
 Common Position switches include:
 QB ---> WR ---Typically very athletic QB's that aren't good enough at QB for the NFL(Julian Edelman for example)
 QB ---> RB ---Typically very athletic QB's that are option type QB's in college who do a lot of running(Michael Robinson for example)
 DE ---> OLB ---Typically "smaller", athletic DE's in college are too small to play DE in the NFL(Jerry Hughes for example)
 CB ---> SF ---Typically slower type CB's in college that have good ball and football instincts but lack the speed to cover WR's or hands to catch the ball in the NFL(Jairius Byrd, Aaron Williams, and Devin McCourty for example)
 WR ---> SF ---Typically slower type WR's that are good playing the ball but lack hands needed at WR(George Wilson for example)
 OT ---> OG ---Typically "smaller" OT's in college that are the size of guards in the NFL(one of the most common--numerous examples)
 LB ---> SF ---Typically "smaller" LB's in college that are athletic and fast enough to play safety but don't have enough size to play LB(Adam Archuleta for example)
 FB ---> TE ---Typically the more athletic FB's in college in a run heavy offensive scheme can make more use of their skills as a TE or H-Back(Charles Clay for example)
 other examples and less common changes occur---
 
 Need to figure out how often and under what circumstances a player would have a different position---currently it sets it to the same position as they are in college
 
 on offense: QB > WR(RB) > RB > FB > TE > OT > OG > OC
 
 CB > S > LB > DE > DT

 players are able To move up Or down 1 slot - so starting from most athletic To least athletic defensively you'd have CB > S > LB > DE > DT. 
 So all a corner could do Is move DOWN. Safeties can move UP Or DOWN to corner Or LB. Any player moving UP would need to have considerable athleticism.
